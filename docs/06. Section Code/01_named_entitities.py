Subject: VPN disconnect issue - escalation needed

Hi team, this is Sarah Chen from Acme Logistics writing in again about
ticket TKT-1042. Our Gold-tier SLA promises a 4 hour response time, and
we are now at hour 6 with no update. The VPN client keeps dropping every
10 minutes on our Windows fleet since the rollout of CloudXeus Connect
v3.2 last Tuesday. If this isn't resolved by end of day Friday we will
be requesting the $500 SLA breach credit outlined in our contract.
